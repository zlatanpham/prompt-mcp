      'Act as an expert curriculum designer and learning architect. Your task is to create a comprehensive, structured learning curriculum following the organizational principles and formatting style of the Mochary Method Curriculum.\n\nCreate a complete curriculum structured like the Mochary Method with these key principles:\n\n### CURRICULUM STRUCTURE APPROACH\n- **Progressive Learning Phases**: Start with onboarding/essentials, move to specialized domains, end with advanced integration\n- **Practical Focus**: Every concept paired with tools, templates, or actionable exercises\n- **Time-Conscious**: Include realistic time estimates for each item\n- **Modular Design**: Items can stand alone but build toward comprehensive mastery\n- **Reflection Integration**: Include moments for self-assessment and commitment to action\n\n### FORMAT THE OUTPUT AS:\n\n#### [Topic Name] Curriculum\nInclude a brief intro with reflection questions:\n```\nMake a copy of this curriculum for yourself. After reading a sub-doc, please write your answers to:\n- Does it resonate, yes or no?\n- What questions or comments do you have?\n- Will you apply it? If yes, what actions will you take?\n```\n\n#### Foundation Phase\n**First-time Onboarding** (3-5 core items)\n- Focus on "what is this and why does it matter"\n- Include key methodology overview\n- Basic orientation materials\n- Format: `- [Title] (X min) - Brief compelling description`\n\n**Essential Reading** (5-8 fundamental items)\n- Core concepts everyone needs to know\n- Foundational skills in logical order\n- Quick wins and immediate applications\n- Include mindset/philosophy pieces\n\n#### Specialization Phase\nOrganize into 4-6 relevant domain areas, such as:\n- **[Domain 1 Name]** (e.g., "Individual Skills", "Technical Foundations")\n- **[Domain 2 Name]** (e.g., "Team Applications", "Advanced Techniques")\n- **[Domain 3 Name]** (e.g., "Process & Systems", "Creative Applications")\n- **[Domain 4 Name]** (e.g., "Leadership", "Troubleshooting")\n\nFor each domain:\n- Start with main concept (2-5 min read)\n- Include sub-items with indentation using hyphens\n- Mix reading lengths: (1 min), (3 min), (15 min), (2 min to read; 45 min to do)\n- Include templates, examples, and exercises\n- Add expert attributions where relevant: "(By [Expert Name])"\n- Note videos, tools, or interactive content\n\n#### Advanced Integration\n**Cross-Domain Skills**\n- Integration across specializations\n- Meta-skills and systems thinking\n- Complex scenarios and edge cases\n\n**All Resources in One Place**\n- Comprehensive reference section\n- Book recommendations (several hours)\n- Complete resource library\n\n#### Specialized Applications (if relevant)\nCreate 2-3 context-specific sections like:\n- **[Specific Context A]** (e.g., "Remote Applications", "Enterprise Scale")\n- **[Specific Context B]** (e.g., "Creative Industries", "Technical Teams")\n\n#### Support & Community\n- **Expert Insights**\n- **Implementation Support**\n- **FAQ**\n- **Templates & Tools**\n\n### FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Use markdown with clear hierarchy (###, -, indented -)\n2. Include time estimates: (2 min), (5 min), (15 min), (several hours)\n3. Mix content types: concepts, tools, templates, exercises, examples\n4. Use compelling, action-oriented descriptions\n5. Include cross-references between related topics\n6. Add expert attributions and external resources\n7. Note special content: Video, Template, (_work in progress_)\n8. Keep individual items digestible (mostly 1-15 min)\n9. Build logical flow within and between sections\n10. Include reflection prompts and practical application guidance\n\n### CONTENT CURATION PRINCIPLES:\n- Prioritize practitioner wisdom over pure theory\n- Include actual tools and templates, not just concepts\n- Balance quick wins with deep development\n- Provide multiple learning modalities\n- Build in clear next steps and action items\n- Create a learning journey, not just a resource list\n\nGenerate a curriculum that feels comprehensive yet approachable, with clear progression from beginner to advanced practitioner in the specified topic.\n\n<topic>\n{topic}\n</topic>',
